  <h2> Who is Laura? </h2>
  <dt><strong>Laura:</strong></dt>
  <dd>An awesome person who you're gonna wanna know more about.</dd>
  <p> Now that you know the real <strong> basics </strong> of who I am, I figured I could give a little more in depth detail about myself.</p>
  <h4> My pronouns are she/her. </h4>
  <p> I identify as a woman and go by she/her pronouns. I have several strong female role models that I look up to.
    My two favorite artists are Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keefe. </p>
  <h4> I am 21 years old. </h4>
  <p> My birthday is on November 3rd. I am a <em> scorpio </em> sun, <em> virgo </em> moon, and <em> leo </em> rising. 
    I am the youngest of three. I have a brother and a sister. </p>
    <p>Kate is the oldest and 10 years older than me. She is a wife and a mother. My niece's name is Charleigh and she turned one in August. </p>
   <p> Sean is the middle child and only 3 years older than me. We both still live at home and he is a manager at an auto repair store. </p>
  <h4> I have a dog. </h4>
  <p> On October 15th of 2020, I adopted a 6 month old puppy and named her Rae. I was told she was a lab mix and after some googling, I have come to the conclusion that she is most likely mixed with Staffordshire Terrier. </p>
   <p> She is now 9 months old and I cannot believe how fast she has grown up. She is extremely spoiled and we go to the local dog park almost everyday so she can play with other dogs and get some much needed daily exercise. </p>
   <p> I love going to the dog park with her when it's not absolutely freezing. I enjoy watching her interact with the other dogs and like being social with the other owners. </p>
  <h4> I am a studio art major. </h4>
  <p> When I first started at Emmanuel, I thought I wanted to be an art therapist but after taking a counseling theories class, I realized I was in the wrong major. 
    From there, I thought about studying to become a high school art teacher but later abandoned that pathway after shadowing a high school art class. 
    After that, I decided I would focus my studies on improving my technique as an artist. I primarily focus on drawing with graphite and charcoal. 
    This semester, I am stepping out of my comfort zone and taking this Interactive Design class along with a graphic design class. I hope to gain valuble skills in both these classes that will hopefully help me in the workforce after I graduate. </p>
  <h4> I do crossfit. </h4>
  <p> For most of my life, I struggled with my mental and physical health but after graduating high school, I decided to try a crossfit class at a local <em> box </em>, a box is what a crossfit gym is called.
    I stopped doing crossfit while at school but always picked it back up when I was home for the summers. Since I have been completely online this school year, I have been able to continue doing crossfit. 
    I love it. It has improved my overall quality of life and given me something to be proud of. I am constantly reaching my goals and creating new ones. 
    I have made so many great friends and am apart of an amazing community. I usually attend at least 4-5 classes per week and like to spend my sundays being an extra lazy couch potato. </p>
